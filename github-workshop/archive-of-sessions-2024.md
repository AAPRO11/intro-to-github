# Hello and Welcome to the Git Good Workshop! 

## About 

This file is Exercise 2 in the Git Good: Introduction to GitHub workshop. 
Please refer to the checkin Issue that we commented on in Exercise 1 to find your number. Then add your answer to the question beside your corresponding number.

## Questions from slidedeck
1. What is the projectâ€™s license?
2. Why do you think this license benefits this project?
3. What platform do they host their code on?

## Question: What have you learned about your case study:

Group 1 (case study name):


Group 2 (case study 2): Arduino
1. License: CC-BY-SA
2. Benefits: Allows for efficient development for arduino hardware or other more special cases where modifications are necessary
3. Platform: Website, and GitHub: https://github.com/arduino/

Group 3 (case study 1): Linux
1. Open source
2. People can create different versions of Linux that can help specific scenarios
3. hosted on Github.

Case study 2: Arduino
1. Open source
2. People can invent new ways to use the Arduino technology to create their own invention,
3. hosted on Github: https://github.com/arduino/

Group 4 (case study 4): Open Source Investigation (OSINT)
1. Creative Commons Attribute - Share Alike
2. Any adaptations must have the same license as the original
3. GitHub


Group 5 (case study 5): Open Source AI
1. Open souce
   People can modifiy it for there own needs so more people will use it
   Github
2. Open source
   Anyone can modiy it for there own needs
3. Pressable: Pressable (listed at the bottom of the page: https://opensource.org/deepdive#cfp) 


Group 6 (case study 1): Linux
1. GNU General Public License version 2 - Copyleft license
2. Why:
3. GitHub: https://github.com/torvalds/linux


Group 7 (case study name):


Group 8 (case study 3): The Turing Way
1. License: CC BY 4.0 and MIT
2. Why: Education so can be shared, accessibility and can be edited to meet requirements, less costly
3. Where hosted: GitHub link: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way

Group 9 (case study name):

LINUX

1. They use an GPL liscence
2. It allows anyone to freely modify and use thier source code for comercial or unpaid projects
3. There source code is hosted on kernel.org.


Group 10 (case study 5): open source AI
1. permissive
2. Promotes Collaboration and Transparency
3. GitHub??

Group 11 (case study name):
Case study 1:
Copyleft
Anyone can change but under same licensing
Kernel.org

Case study 2: Arduino
1. CC BB SA
2. lets other distribute work commercially 
3. GitHub: https://github.com/arduino/

Case study 3: The Turing Way
1. CC BY 4.0 and MIT
2. Anyone can edit however you have to credit
3. GitHub: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way

Group 12 Linux:
1. GNU GPL
2. Open source operating system which allows free access and modification
3. GitHub: (https://github.com/torvalds/linux

Group 13 (Case Study Name: Linux):
1. The license used for Linux us GNU GPL as it is publicly available.
2. It allows for collaboration between diffferent people to modify and use which is beneficial to the original and modified versions.
3. Linux uses GitHub to host its code: https://github.com/torvalds/linux


Group 14 (case study name Linux):
1. License = GNU GPL
2. Easy to modify and easy to collaborate
3. GitHub: https://github.com/torvalds/linux

Group 15 (case study name): 


Group 16 (case study 2): Arduino)
1. Open source 
2. Easy to use and enables people to share ideas about what they are producing. Being open source, also allows multiple people to work on one project to improve it at a faster rate. 
3. It is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/arduino/

Group 17 (case study 1): Linux
1. open source
2. flexibility, create apps
2. source code: GitHub: https://github.com/torvalds/linux

Group 15 (case study 3): The Turing Way
1. The Turing Way has two open source licenses: CC BY 4.0 and MIT
2. It is based on ethical research by a group of data scientists and therefore y making it an open source license it ensures everyone has an opinion on a research program being  investigated by data scientists
3. It is hosted on Github: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way

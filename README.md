# Git Good: Introduction to Github

This repository has been set up to accompany the Introduction to GitHub workshop. 


## About this Repository

This repository takes inspiration and guidance provided in *[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome)* handbook to data science on how to set up and structure a repository to support collaboration in data science projects. It includes files and directories that are recommended for enabling collaboration in a project, as well as sharing of research outputs.

When reusing this repository, please update information on your README page with information about your project.


## About the README

On an online repository, such as GitHub, the project overview page is named ‘README’ which is equivalent to the main page of a website.
README page should describe the project -- what is the purpose of the project, who is involved, how to collaborate and where to find key resources.

To learn more about how to create a README.md file, please read the [Landing Page - README File](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-repo/project-repo-readme.html) chapter in The Turing Way Guide for Project Design.
